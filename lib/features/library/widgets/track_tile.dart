/// uncluttered. Status is still surfaced — but only as one subtle glyph next to
/// the menu, never as a large control: its download task and whether the row
/// still plays with its server away, both handled by [TrackStatusGlyph].
///
/// Tapping the row plays the tapped track and queues the rest of [tracks]
/// behind it, then opens the now-playing screen — unchanged from before.
///
/// Selection: when [selectable] is set, a long-press starts multi-select via
/// [onSelectStart] and, while [selectionActive], a tap toggles this row via
/// [onSelectToggle] instead of playing. Hosts that don't pass these (e.g.
/// Favorites) keep the plain tap-to-play behaviour.
///
/// With a keyboard attached the modifiers a desktop list is expected to honour
/// work too (#387), whether or not a selection is already running: Ctrl-click
/// (Cmd on macOS) toggles this row alone, and Shift-click extends from the last
/// row picked to this one through [onSelectRange]. They are read off the
/// hardware keyboard at tap time rather than gated on a platform, so a keyboard
/// case on a tablet gets them for free and a bare touch tap is unchanged.
///
/// On desktop the row is also a drag source for playlists (#389): pulling it
/// sideways picks up this track, or the whole selection when this row is part
/// of one, and dropping it on a playlist adds it. A vertical drag still
/// scrolls the list, and nothing about this exists on mobile. The keyboard and
/// menu route to the same operation, "Add to playlist", is unchanged and stays
/// the accessible path.
///
/// Source-awareness: offline/download actions only appear for *remote* tracks
/// (resolved through [remoteTrackDownloaderProvider], the same seam the
/// download repository uses). On-device tracks are already local, so showing
/// "Download for offline" on them would be meaningless — they only get the
